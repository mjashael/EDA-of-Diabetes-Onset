# mjashael-EDA-of-Diabetes-Onset
An Exploration of Key Health Indicators (SQL, SAS, Tableau &amp; Excel,)

*Project Background:*
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early prediction of diabetes can lead to better management and treatment of the disease, thereby improving the quality of life for patients. This project aims to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing health indicators like age, gender, BMI, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. The dataset used in this project is comprehensive, and the EDA will provide valuable insights into the relationships between different health indicators and their role in predicting diabetes onset.

*Project Statement:*
The goal of this project is to predict the onset of diabetes based on health indicators such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. The challenge lies in identifying the most significant factors and understanding their interplay in contributing to the onset of diabetes.

*About Dataset:*

The Diabetes prediction dataset is a collection of medical and demographic data from patients, along with their diabetes status (positive or negative). The data includes features such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. his can be useful for healthcare professionals in identifying patients who may be at risk of developing diabetes and in developing personalized treatment plans. Additionally, the dataset can be used by researchers to explore the relationships between various medical and demographic factors and the likelihood of developing diabetes.

*Domain Knowledge:*
Age: The risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with age. This is due to various factors such as increased weight, decreased physical activity, and the body’s reduced ability to metabolize sugar. More than 25% of Americans aged 65 and older have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.
Hypertension: High blood pressure and diabetes often occur together. High blood pressure increases the force of blood through your arteries and can damage artery walls. Having both high blood pressure and diabetes can greatly increase your risk for heart disease.
Heart Disease: People with diabetes are twice as likely to have heart disease or a stroke than someone who doesn’t have diabetes. Over time, high blood sugar from diabetes can damage blood vessels as well as nerves in and around your heart.
Smoking History: Smoking can lead to type 2 diabetes. Nicotine changes cells so they don’t respond to insulin, which increases blood sugar levels. If you smoke, you’re 30% to 40% more likely to get type 2 diabetes than people who don’t smoke.
Body Mass Index (BMI): A higher BMI is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Those in the highest BMI group had an 11-fold increased risk of diabetes compared to participants in the lowest BMI group.
Hemoglobin A1c: Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is a measure of the average blood glucose level over the past 2–3 months. Higher HbA1c levels indicate poorer blood sugar control and a higher risk of diabetes complications.
Blood Glucose Level: High blood glucose levels can lead to the development of diabetes. When blood glucose levels are consistently high, it can damage blood vessels and nerves, leading to complications such as heart disease, kidney disease, and nerve damage.
