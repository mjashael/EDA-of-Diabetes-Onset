# EDA-of-Diabetes-Onset
An Exploration of Key Health Indicators (SQL, SAS, Tableau &amp; Excel,)

*Project Background:*
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early prediction of diabetes can lead to better management and treatment of the disease, thereby improving the quality of life for patients. This project aims to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing health indicators like age, gender, BMI, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. The dataset used in this project is comprehensive, and the EDA will provide valuable insights into the relationships between different health indicators and their role in predicting diabetes onset.

*Project Statement:*
The goal of this project is to predict the onset of diabetes based on health indicators such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. The challenge lies in identifying the most significant factors and understanding their interplay in contributing to the onset of diabetes.

*About Dataset:*

The Diabetes prediction dataset is a collection of medical and demographic data from patients, along with their diabetes status (positive or negative). The data includes features such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. his can be useful for healthcare professionals in identifying patients who may be at risk of developing diabetes and in developing personalized treatment plans. Additionally, the dataset can be used by researchers to explore the relationships between various medical and demographic factors and the likelihood of developing diabetes.
